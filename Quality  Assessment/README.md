No-Reference Retinal Image Quality Visual Assessment Metric Protocol.
==========================
This is an evaluation criterion for unsupervised retinal image noise reduction tasks. Due to the lack of pairs of clean and noisy images, we formulate a metric for evaluating No-reference quality.
The main assessment indicators come from three points: (1) Lesion structure; (2) Background Color; (3) Generating extra Structure.

# Lesion Structure
